{"name":"BattleBot","tagline":"!CREATE, !JOIN, PLAY!","body":"# IRC Pick-Up Game Operator Bot\r\n\r\nI have created an IRC bot that will allow users to easily create and join pick-up games.  \r\n(For example etqw/et/csgo and any other (type of) game).\r\n\r\nTo check it out, join the #battlebot irc channel on Quakenet! ( irc://irc.quakenet.org/battlebot )   \r\nhttp://webchat.quakenet.org/   \r\nhttp://www.team-aero.org/team-aero_esports/aero_tv.php  \r\n  \r\nmIRC: http://www.mirc.com/   \r\nXChat: http://xchat.org/  \r\nAdiIRC: https://adiirc.com/\r\n\r\n## Quick reference:\r\n   \r\n#### Basic commands\r\n- <b>!help</b> - <i>This will return a list of available commands.</i>  \r\n- <b>!create</b> - <i>This will return a list of available games.</i>   \r\n- <b>!serverlist</b> - <i>This will return a list of available servers.</i>   \r\n- <b>!queue</b> - <i>This will return a list of available pugs currently in queue to join.</i>  \r\n- <b>!info</b> - <i>This will return a list of teams and their players, currently signed up for a pug. If no additional values are supplied, it will return the info of the pug you are currently in queue for. For example: !info etqw 4v4 </i>  \r\n    \r\n#### PUG commands  \r\n- <b>!create</b> [game] [mode] [skill] [server]  \r\n- <b>!join</b> [game] [mode] [skill] [team#]  \r\n- <b>!need</b>  \r\n- <b>!leave</b>  \r\n- <b>!start</b>  \r\n- <b>!callvote</b> [mode] [value]  \r\n- <b>!vote</b> [yes/no]  \r\n  \r\nWhen a pick-up is filled or started, every player will be notified to join the server by having the ip and password sent to them in a pm. The pug will then be removed from queue and another one of the same game and mode may be started.  \r\n(You can always start mutliple pugs at the same time if they are not identical)  \r\n  \r\nGreetings, Crytiqal.Aero  \r\n\r\n## Command usage:\r\n\r\n#### Create a PUG  \r\n- <b>!create</b> [game] [mode] [skill] [server]\r\n\r\n<i>For example:</i> <b>!create etqw 4v4 low</b> <i>OR</i> <b>!create etqw 4v4 med server1</b> <i>OR</i> <b>!create etqw 4v4 pro 123.456.7.890:27733 mypw</b>\r\n\r\n[game] - <i>Pick a game that is supported.</i>  \r\n[mode] - <i>Pick a gamemode that is <b>supported</b> for that game (<b>4v4</b> / <b>2v2v2</b> / <b>2v6v4</b> etc).</i>  \r\n[skill] - <i>Pick a skill level that is supported for that game (<b>low</b> / <b>med</b> / <b>high</b> / <b>pro</b> etc).</i>  \r\n[server] - <i>Pick a server for the game.</i>   \r\n<i>(If you leave this value blank, the bot will automatically select a default server from a pre-defined list, that is not currently in use by another pug in queue. You can also specify <b>which</b> default server you would like to use, by entering a value returned by typing !serverlist . In addition, you can also provide your own server (and password) in the following syntax: ip:port (pw). If this ip:port is already in use by another pug, you are asked to provide a different server)</i>    \r\n  \r\nYou will automatically be the owner of the pug, and be granted special commands such as !start and !remove. (Additional commands like !kick,!ban,!unban, !shuffle will likely be added in the future)  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n#### Join a PUG  \r\n- <b>!join</b> [game] [mode] [skill] [team#]\r\n\r\n<i>For example:</i> <b>!join etqw 4v4 med 2</b> <i>(joins team 2)</i>   \r\n<i>Provide the game, mode and skill because several pick-up games with different modes and skill levels of the same game can be in queue at the same time! Provide the <#> of the team you would like to join (1/2/3/4 OR A/B/C/D etc). If you fail to provide a teamID, the bot will automatically add you to the first available slot.</i>  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n#### Leave a PUG  \r\n- <b>!leave</b>  \r\n<i>This will remove you from the pug you are currently enlisted in.   \r\nIf you are the owner of the pug, the ownership will be transferred to the next player in the line-up.   \r\nIf no such player is found, the pug will be removed from queue.</i>  \r\n  \r\n#### PUG Player commands  \r\n- <b>!need</b>  \r\n<i>This will show how many players are still needed for the pug you are currently enlisted in.</i>  \r\n  \r\n- <b>!callvote</b> [mode]  \r\n<i>For example:</i> <b>!callvote kick</b> [playerNAME/playerID]  \r\n<i>When no playerNAME/playerID is given, the bot will return a list of current players and their ID's in your team.  \r\nThe vote will be valid for a set period of time (2min) and players of the same team can cast their vote within this time.  \r\nWhen the vote reaches >50% within the valid time, the vote is granted.</i>  \r\n \r\nOnly 1 vote possible per team at a time. The votecaller will be placed in a timeout to prevent him from spamming votes and give others a chance to call a vote of their own. The timeout is set to 3 min OR when a new vote has been called.\r\n  \r\n- <b>!vote</b> [yes/no]  \r\n<i>For example:</i> <b>!vote yes</b> <i>OR</i> <b>!vote no</b>  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n#### PUG Owner commands  \r\n- <b>!remove</b>   \r\n<i>This will remove the entire pug from the queue. (Only pick-up owners have the power to remove a pug from queue)</i>  \r\n  \r\n- <b>!start</b>  \r\n<i>Only pick-up owners can use this command to force start a Pick-Up Game.</i>  \r\n\r\n  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
