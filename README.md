# IRC Pick-Up Game Operator Bot

I have created an IRC bot that will allow users to easily create and join pick-up games.  
(For example etqw/et/csgo and any other (type of) game).

To check it out, join the #battlebot irc channel on Quakenet! ( irc://irc.quakenet.org/battlebot )   
http://webchat.quakenet.org/

mIRC: http://www.mirc.com/   
XChat: http://xchat.org/  
AdiIRC: https://adiirc.com/

## Usage:
   
#### Basic commands
- <b>!help</b> - <i>This will return a list of available commands.</i>  
- <b>!create</b> - <i>This will return a list of available games.</i>   
- <b>!serverlist</b> - <i>This will return a list of available servers.</i>   
- <b>!queue</b> - <i>This will return a list of available pugs currently in queue to join.</i>  
- <b>!info</b> - <i>This will return a list of teams and their players, currently signed up for a pug. If no additional values are supplied, it will return the info of the pug you are currently in queue for. For example: !info etqw 4v4 </i>  
    
#### PUG commands  
- <b>!create</b> [game] [mode] [skill] [server]  
- <b>!join</b> [game] [mode] [skill] [team#]  
- <b>!need</b>  
- <b>!leave</b>  
- <b>!start</b>  
- <b>!callvote</b> [mode] [value]  
- <b>!vote</b> [yes/no]  
  
When a pick-up is filled or started, every player will be notified to join the server by having the ip and password sent to them in a pm. The pug will then be removed from queue and another one of the same game and mode may be started.  
(You can always start mutliple pugs at the same time if they are not identical)
